# TAG Privacy Task Force - 22 March 2023

Present: Dan, Jeffrey, Don, Wendy, Nick, Pete
Regrets: Robin, Amy, Sam, Tess

## [Mention harm from partially blocking cross-context PR#227](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/227)

Jeffrey: in response to ... by partially blocking cross-context recognition we can create pressure on industry... 

Dan: is it a principle?

Jeffrey: it's talking about what UAs are supposed to to divide things up.. 

Dan: maybe it can be ?

Jeffrey: 2.1 there is a principle - and all the rest of elaboration.. not sure that there is a need for a principle in this elaboration.  We might have higher level principle that if you can partially prevent a harm but not completely then you should prevent it?  But that may not be the case in all cases...

Nick: I like describing the incentivies / issues of multi-context sites. But yeah I wouldn't see it a new principle.

**took decision to merge**

## Issues

### https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/issues/228

Jeffrey: coming from reviews inside of Google. By writing a whole doc about privacy and sketching ethical issues then we risk that we weigh privacy ahead of other concerns... Stronger statement that this doesn't outweigh the other principles?

Dan: whataboutism?

Jeffrey: somewhat - but there are trade-offs with EWP and we want people to think about trade-offs.

Nick: 2nd sentence of the document specifically says that we're not doing that. I think 2nd sentence is pretty prominent.

Jeffrey: I'll bring that back to this commenter. 

Dan: there is also [societal impacts](https://w3ctag.github.io/societal-impact-questionnaire/). Also [Security worksho](https://www.w3.org/2023/03/secure-the-web-forward/) 

Don: one concern of having a privacy principles doc is that often privacy harms are downstream from other problems on the web.  Cross-context sharing, e.g., are often a product of deceptive practices perpetrated against advertisers by intermediaries. Include a list of other principles documents that should exist?

Dan: i think we leave the issue open for now - but also don't think it deserves new text.

### https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/issues/229

Jeffrey: opt-in-opt-out... 

Nick: seems Robin is saying we could ... [comment](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/issues/229#issuecomment-1478726105) .. wouldn't it maybe be the case that we would expect consent applies to things that could be more sensitive... 

Jeffrey: you want people to consent to saving 5 articles... saving a list of recently read articles...  maybe that doesn't require consent?

Pete: cross-context or within the same context?

Jeffrey: our text doesn't say cross-context.  

Nick: i don't think it's sensitive if the web site I've visited knows what pages i visited.. but i do think it's sensitive if another web site knows what pages i've visited.

Wendy: rephrase the underlying text - similar to robin's suggestion... people should be able to consent to otherwise restricted purposes... 

Nick: is it about purposes or consenting to otherwise restricted processing / activities?

Don: we could say "more sensitive processing such as recognized cross-context" instead of "with a company" a company could be a service provider, the company that operates the site, or a problematic third party, this "company" wording is not clear

Nick: we may also need to do somehting about purposes.. but we should make it clear regarding cross-context sharing.  

Jeffrey: i like wendy's suggestion...  I can **draft a PR.**
