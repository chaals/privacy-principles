# Privacy Principles — Robin Remix

This is a quick and dirty rewrite following Jeffrey's invitation and our recent discussion about how
to present the content better than through the concatenation of two documents. I am only including
sketches of the content to give a sense for where they fit and why; it's not a proper rewrite.

## Why Privacy

The Web is for everyone. This means that it needs to be built to serve people and to serve human
values. One of the ways in which the Web can serve people is by protecting them in the face of
asymmetries of power.

Information is power. It can be used to predict and to influence people, as well as to design online
spaces that control people's behaviour. What's more, automation renders information more efficient.

Privacy is about the rules that govern information flows, and more precisely it is about how these
rules constrain and distribute the power of information between different actors. Struggles over
privacy are struggles over the rules that govern the power of data, they are about data governance.

There are always privacy rules — the question is which ones best serve human values. So privacy is
_instrumental_ to using data in service of a space designed _for_ everyone.

Tk we should not be asking people to set rules for everything all the time. Include notions of
consent and agency here. Who does the privacy labour?

## What Is Privacy

Tk this is where we use CI and all that. Basically make it about defining rules in an institutional
setting. Ctx = set of purposes.

## How To Implement Privacy

Tk how to make the rules real. Why trust matters and how it gets created.

### It's _Your_ Browser

Tk trustworthy/fiduciary notions

### Browser Protections

Tk all the things that browsers can do

### Rules & Institutions

Tk all the things that aren't supported directly by browsers, but that we expect from systems.
Notably, it's important that this would include collective governance for security systems. Maybe
also mention that consent is individualistic and imbalances of power can often be best redressed
using collective tools.

## Appendix: Common Concepts

This section contains definitions for terms mentioned in the document that are not defined before
they are used. The idea is that, if a term is common enough that people will naturally understand it
but that it could nevertheless benefit from a strict definition in order to provide a common
foundation for debate, then it goes here.

## Notes

* Add MaxG to the acks for the serendipitous discussion that helped this structure gel.
